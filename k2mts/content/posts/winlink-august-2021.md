Prior to this month my only understanding of [Winlink](https://winlink.org) was that it was used by rich dudes on yachts to avoid having to pay for satphone service. While that [may or may not be true](https://www.cruisingworld.com/staying-connected-at-sea/), it's an interesting way to stay in touch with fellow hams, or for public service / emergency communications use.
